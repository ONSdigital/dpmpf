# Please note: this package is no longer under development nor is it being maintained.

[dpmaccount](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dpmaccount) and [dpmall](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dpmall) packages.


## Purpose

**dpmpf** is the back end for package [dpmaccpf](https://github.com/ONSDigital/dpmaccpf) (also no longer being maintained). End users should never need to interact with **dpmaccpf** directly. 

## Interface

### Functions for creating cohort data models

Internal functions within **dpmaccpf** call functions within **dpmpf** to set up cohort-level data models. The current set-up functions are:

| Function                 | Description                            |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| `new_CdmNoregPoibin()`   | No regions, Poisson-binomial mixture   |
| `new_CdmWithregPoibin()` | With regions, Poisson-binomial mixture |
| `new_CdmNoregNbinom()`   | No regions, Negative binomial          |
| `new_CdmWithregNbinom()` | With regions, Negative binomial        |

These functions all create objects with C++ classses.

### Function for launching an individual particle filter

Function `create_run_destroy_pfilter()`

- sets up a particle filter,
- uses the particle filter to estimate demographic quantities,
- writes those quantities to disk as CSV files, and then
- deletes the particle filter.

## Coding standards

We are using the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org), and run function `styler::style_pkg()` regularly.

We are aiming for maximum simplicity, transparency, and maintainability. Most people reading this code will be more familiar with R than with C++, so the C++ code follows R rather than C++ conventions, and minimises the use of techniques that are specific to C++.
